# KNN-and-SVM-Natural-Language-Processing-Tweet-Stats

This project utilizes several machine learning libraries to get natural text data from twitter and use them to populate a database for classification utlizing KNN and SVM classification algorithms. The purpose for this project is for study of classification techniiques, data analysis, and the Python programming language

# Libraries used

The Python libraries used are as follows.

TextBlob
---

This library provides APIs for natural language processing that faciclitate processes like sentiment analysis, tokenization, translation, etc.

For more information and documentation visit https://textblob.readthedocs.io/en/dev/

Pandas
---

Pandas provides a means for data analysis and for this project it is used for data normalization and data plotting

More info and documentation at http://pandas.pydata.org/

Scikit-learn
---

This library is where the classification algorithms originate and are used for this project.
